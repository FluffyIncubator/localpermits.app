This is a static site that enables people living in Philadelphia to easily check if there will be demolition near their home.

## Why track demos?
Many parts of Philadelphia have toxic chemicals in the buildings and even in the ground. Demolitions can kick up dust and particles that can lead to health risks, especially in children. If a demo will be happening near you, you should look up how to prepare safely for it to protect your children, pets, and yourselves.
